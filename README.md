This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Justification

I have decided to rewrite my code running on https://c4ldas.com.br and the APIs created on that for Next.js. The current page is written using Nodejs/Express.js

Using App Router on Next.js currently and storing front pages on /(frontend) directory to clear as much as possible the app folder.


## Structure

At the moment the structure of the application is:

```
/
|public/
|app/
|  |--(frontend)/    # pending
|  |  |-- lol/       # pending
|  |  |-- tft/       # pending
|  |
|  |--api/
|     |-- lol/       # done
|     |-- spotify/   # pending
|     |-- steam/     # pending
|     |-- tft/       # pending
|     |-- twitch/    # pending
|     |-- valorant/  # pending
|     |-- youtube/   # pending
```
